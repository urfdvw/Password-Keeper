## Why
This DIY project is a USB password management device for people who
- hate auto-saving passwords on browsers
- use public computers or changes devices all the time
- are forced to set a different "strong" password every month (me)
- have a lot of super-long passwords, such as Github keys and SSH keys.

This project focus on user experiences. It is not for the highest security.

## Based on

## How to make
- Make the PCB according to the graber file
- Solder the components on to the PCB board
- Install CircuitPython on the Pi Pico
- Copy the code to the CIRCUITPY drive
